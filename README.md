# Mini-Projects

A collection of mini-projects created by an 11th grader from India exploring the world of programming.

These projects are built in different programming languages as part of my learning journey. The goal is simple: practice, experiment, and grow.

I share them here not just to track my progress but also to connect with others who love programming.

Your feedback is valuable! Even though these projects are small right now, they’re stepping stones. With time, I’ll move toward more advanced and impactful projects.
