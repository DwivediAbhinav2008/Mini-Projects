# Mini-Projects
Mini Projects created by a high school student interested in programming.
Here I will upload small projects created with any programming language. I am doing this to solidify my learning and interact with others to learn more.
I request the visitors to try my projects, yet they are small. Soon I will move to advanced and more valuable projects.
